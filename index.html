When Australia burns, the earth burns. Which part is it that doesn't affect you?

We only have one planet. Protecting him is the duty of all, united, as if we were one inhabitant on the planet.

I would like to appeal to all people of goodwill to ask their governments in the northern hemisphere to work together by exchanging their firefighting resources with those in the southern hemisphere. Ask your governments to offer their country's firefighting resources to Australia (do not let them be idle during our winter, when Australia is burning and can make good use of them). Maybe next summer, it will be your country who needs to ask for some extra help.

I am a Spanish citizen and will open a petition in my country to ask for all available help they can send to Australia. If you are in other countries, please do the same and we will join with the tag #GlobalHumanBeigns on twitter.

It's not about my country, it's about our planet!
